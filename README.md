# lum.db.php

## Summary

Database abstraction base classes for PHP.

This package is not meant to be used directly, but via one of the extensions:

* [PDO/SQL](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.db-pdo.php)
* [MongoDB](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.db-mongo.php)

Previous versions had all classes for different databases in this package;
as of version `3.0.0`, I've split them into the above extension packages.

## Official URLs
